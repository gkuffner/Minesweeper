# Minesweeper
Repository for a command-line Minesweeper game started during my first semester on University, in which I had the basics of Python.

Changes to be added:
1. Multiple languages (or English, at least)
2. Recursion including "1" as well
3. Indication around the board for the lines and columns' numbers
4. Maybe some timer?
5. Maybe some score to be saved and compared futurely amongst other players?
6. Custom board size with custom mine numbers
7. Better symbols for mines, closed and marked tiles
